# Classification Overview in R

Welcome to the **Classification-Overview** repository! This project provides a concise and beginner-friendly overview of key classification techniques in R. Each method is presented through clean, well-documented Jupyter Notebooks with simple interpretations and real-world-friendly explanations.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

This repository contains the following notebooks:

1. **1.Classification-Overview.ipynb**  
   A high-level summary of classification techniques and how they are applied in R.

2. **2.Naive-Bayes-R-with-simple-interpretation.ipynb**  
   Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier in R, including a basic explanation of how it works and how to interpret the results.

3. **3.Discriminant-Analysis-R-with-simple-interpretation.ipynb**  
   Linear and/or Quadratic Discriminant Analysis in R, focused on intuitive understanding and interpretation.

4. **4.Logistic-Regression-R-with-simple-interpretation.ipynb**  
   A hands-on walkthrough of logistic regression in R, emphasizing clarity and simplicity in explanation.
