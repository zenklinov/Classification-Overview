    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes-based GDA model demonstrates very good classification accuracy (93.33%) on the Iris dataset. It classifies `setosa` with perfect precision and recall. Minor confusion occurs between `virginica` and `versicolor`, likely due to overlapping distributions in feature space. Overall, the model performs reliably and is suitable for multi-class classification tasks where the assumption of normally distributed predictors is reasonable.\n"
