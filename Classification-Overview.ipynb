    "# Overview of Classification Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naive Bayes\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence between predictors. It calculates the posterior probability for each class and selects the class with the highest probability. The equation for Naive Bayes is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(C|X) = \\frac{P(C) \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i|C)}{P(X)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( P(C|X) \\) is the posterior probability of class \\( C \\) given the features \\( X \\).\n",
    "- \\( P(C) \\) is the prior probability of class \\( C \\).\n",
    "- \\( P(x_i|C) \\) is the likelihood of feature \\( x_i \\) given class \\( C \\).\n",
    "- \\( P(X) \\) is the probability of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discriminant Analysis\n",
    "Discriminant Analysis, specifically Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), is a classification method that assumes the data is normally distributed and tries to find a linear combination of features that best separates two or more classes. The equation for LDA is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x} + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( \\mathbf{w} \\) is the weight vector (linear coefficients).\n",
    "- \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) is the feature vector.\n",
    "- \\( b \\) is the bias term.\n",
    "- \\( y \\) is the decision boundary for class prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a linear model for binary classification. It estimates the probability of a class using the logistic function. The equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(y=1|X) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x} + b)}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( P(y=1|X) \\) is the probability of class 1 given the features \\( X \\).\n",
    "- \\( \\mathbf{w} \\) is the weight vector.\n",
    "- \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) is the feature vector.\n",
    "- \\( b \\) is the bias term.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluating Classification Models\n",
    "Evaluating classification models involves using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. For a binary classification, the accuracy is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( TP \\) is True Positive.\n",
    "- \\( TN \\) is True Negative.\n",
    "- \\( FP \\) is False Positive.\n",
    "- \\( FN \\) is False Negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategies for Imbalanced Data\n",
    "Imbalanced data occurs when the classes in a dataset are not equally distributed. Common strategies to handle imbalanced data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resampling Techniques**:\n",
    "   - **Oversampling**: Increase the number of minority class samples.\n",
    "   - **Undersampling**: Decrease the number of majority class samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use of Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - Use algorithms that are robust to class imbalance like Random Forest, XGBoost, or use weighted loss functions in models like Logistic Regression or SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Synthetic Data Generation**:\n",
    "   - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Creates synthetic samples of the minority class by interpolating between existing minority samples.\n"

    "  From the confusion matrix, we can calculate the accuracy. Here, accuracy is quite high due to the correct classification of most samples.\n",

    "- **Accuracy**: The model’s accuracy is improved as it can now classify all instances correctly.\n",
    "- **Precision**: Precision for all classes is 100%, meaning the model is very accurate for all classes.\n",
    "- **Recall**: Recall is 100%, showing that all true instances of Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica are identified.\n",

    "From the confusion matrices and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score), we can conclude the following:\n",

    "- Logistic Regression’s binary classification approach may not be as suitable for multiclass classification without adjustments.\n",
